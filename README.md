# Probability & Statistics Capstone: Autostock-Analysis: An Interactive Dashboard

# Data Set
Our project analyzes returns of the previous 5 years of the Automotive industry. Our aim is to perform exploratory data analysis on stocks of automobile manufacturing companies to understand the change on log return over time. The market saw a lot of variation when Covid hit and now that we are proceeding towards recession, our time period (i.e. from 1st January 2017 to 1st october 2022), focuses on the log returns from before, during and after the pandemic. The data was scraped using yahoo finance. It includes the opening and closing price, volume, and adjusted volume of the tickers. We have incorporated various Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, statsmodels, and seaborn to plot, model and analyze the data.
